# NP-Program
Collection of programs written by NP-chaonay

Remark: Folder "Standalone" is moved to "Standalone-NoStandard-NoTested", because it is contains code that haven't written in fully-standard and tested. See below for details. This name convention also appiled on further folder.
```
There is many type of quality-checking as following (not limited to):
	- Standard-Without-Tested: A code that entirely uses good-code-standard, this kind of code requires much effort and time, while normal/casual coding cannot achieve this. However this kind of code indicates that no good-testing is appiled.
	- Standard-Tested: Same as above but passed simple testing, so it may not a complex testing. Simple testing can be acheive by looking through each procedures of the program of flowchart and searching for possible bugs.
	- Non-Standard-Tested: Seems weird but it is possible that my code will be categorized into this group, this group is written without fully using good-code-standard, but authors/contributors ensure that simple testing is done and can be used.
	- Non-Standard-Nor-Tested: Both not using good-code-standard and not be tested.
Conclude: If you want stable program enough, using tested one; however if you cannot avoid, using one that has standard-flagged, this one has code that is designed to be easily debugged/used/edited/etc. .
What is mentioned good-code-standard?
	= It is the my standard appiled to my code/software, the standard is not currently written in any of my documentations, you may say the standard is how I coding internally, also I have written standard's procedure in my writing-notes, in order to know what to do and handle on my code. You may see much difference between standard-used-code and non-standard-used-code.
